# Algorithms and Exercises

A personal collection of coding exercises and algorithm implementations.  
This repository serves as a **showcase and learning archive**, containing solutions in various programming languages.

Feel free to browse, get inspired, or compare implementations â€” but please note that this is primarily a **learning repository**, not a production library.
