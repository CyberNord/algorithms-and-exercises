# Algorithms and Exercises

A personal collection of coding exercises, algorithm implementations, and small experiments.  
This repository serves as a **showcase and learning archive**, containing small-scale solutions written out of personal interest and curiosity to improve problem-solving skills.

Most of my **university exercises and assignments** (covering algorithms, programming basics, and advanced exercises) can be found on my **GitLab account**.  
My **GitHub profile**, on the other hand, features larger university and personal projects.  

This repository focuses purely on **independent practice and exploration** — solutions I’ve implemented to experiment, learn, and keep my coding skills sharp.

Feel free to browse, get inspired, or compare implementations — but please note that this is primarily a **learning repository**, not a production library.
